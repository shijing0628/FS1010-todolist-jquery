2021-1-31

html, css, jquery, jquery-ui

**Assignment requirement**

### Please include:

- Users type in the input field and press enter
- When they press enter, use the input value and add it as a list item to the unordered list under the input field.
- When a user clicks on a list item, the checkbox should fill. And text should turn grey to indicate that it has been "done."

### Helpful Tips:

- Start with a "document ready"
- Research "event binding" in jQuery
- You will have to "prevent default" behaviour
- Use concatenation to add HTML elements.

### Optional Extra's to Add:

- allow the removal of items completely from the list
- automatically move completed items to the bottom
- error if input is empty
- Advanced Things to Try:
  drag/drop sort items (have a look at jQuery UI)
- when the page loads focus on the input field (i.e. cursor should load inside input, ready to type)
- SASS creating animation background (Problem is once add this animation, buttons function seems sometimes working, sometimes not working. Remove this feature for now.)

- Add item from item input area, and it will display at the list.
